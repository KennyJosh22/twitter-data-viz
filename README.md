Python Version Used: Python 3.7.7

To read the JSON from GitHub repo:

- If you encounter this error when reading json: urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1049)>
	-  If you're using macOS go to Macintosh HD > Applications > Python3.7 folder (or whatever version of python you're using) > double click on "Install Certificates.command" file.



Audience Engagement Definition:

- Defined by the number of likes for the tweet. I think it makes perfect sense that the audience will engage in the tweets by liking or not liking the tweets. 
- I was thinking on using the number of retweets as well, but I think most accounts do not typically retweet as often as they like tweets.
